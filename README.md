# Some considerations on the thick sample thickness in X-ray fluorescence analysis

This is the softwere for calculating the thick sample thickness for multi-compound samples and polychromatic x-ray source in x-ray fluorescence analysis. 

Files contain:
- `main.ipynb` - source code for calculation with further descriptions,
- `config.txt` - configuration of calculations,
- `beam.txt` - x-ray source spectra,
- `SAMPLE/input.txt` - sample chemical composition.

A more user-friendly application is planned to be released.
